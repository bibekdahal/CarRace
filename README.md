# Car Race

A Car game with realistic physics and powerful game engine. While the game is incomplete and least playful, the most attractive thing in this project is the Game Engine.

# The Game Engine

The game engine uses **Entity-Component-System** architecture, which make the engine very flexible in its features. Basically, one can add as many features to this engine as one likes by simply creating new Components and Systems. Another beautiful feature is the support of **Lua scripting**. Entities' behaviours can be controlled by writing new scripts and attaching the scripts to them. Yet another nice feature is the support of Bullet physics library to simulate the realistic 3D physics including car physics.

While I don't intend to continue this project, my new game/game-engine projects will certainly be based majorly on this on.
